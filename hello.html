			<p>The best thing I read recently was an article from Apple's 2018 WWDC keynote.<br>The article, accompanied by a video, discussed how a smooth, fluid interface is critical in modern day interface design. The author mentioned user interfaces initially started with imitating real-life objects and textures, such as a bookshelf and a glass panel. As designs mature, they evolved into a more direct and simple approach allowing users to engage with digital contents on our phone, without being insulate by life-like elements as we become more familiar with flat design elements.
			</p>
			<p>However, as people's eyes are so used to interacting with physical object, we would expect smooth and frictionless process when interacting with the digital elements. This expectation translates into pressure for better hardware delivering timely response from our gadgets, and reduced tolerance for hardwares with delayed responsiveness. Moreover, designers can also implement gestures as navigational elements since it encourages discovery by creating affordance similar to how we interact with physical objects.
			</p>
			<p>While these would provide amazing experiences for users, the technical aspect of it also pose challenge for engineers. For example, iPhone's pioneering fluid animation allows users to halt an action before it has been completed. To achieve this, iPhone has to recognise the users finger position at given moment, and also smoothen the consequences caused by conflicting gestures to prevent the phone or app from crashing.
